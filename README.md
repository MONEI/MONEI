UNI
=====================================

MONEI's Cryptocurrency with fiat parity, Ethereum powered initially.

## Value
We're working with UNIE as UNI (you and me) and E (Euro). We will add new parity coins like UNIU (Usd) or UNIG (Gbp) in the future.

| EUR        | VALUE           | CURRENCY TICKER | DECIMALS |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| 1      | 1 | UNIE | 8


It's possible that people interested in buying your UNIs are willing to close the deal at a higher or lower rate than the reference currency, as the quantity issued is limited.

## Real use cases not supported by banks

Send micropayments

Create recurring transactions (send UNI's) every second or pre-defined time frames

Create transactions (send UNI's) based on events (fully flexible API to process payments)

Send UNI's to shared wallets

Send UNI's to email addresses, mobile phones or any device

Create more UNI's based on the interest of users of converting their fiat into UNI

Share part of the comissions (buy and sell UNI's) with the community by giving interest to the users holding the UNI's in the Smart Contract

## Quantities to be issued

We're emiting 10,000 units of UNIE as of 1stQ 2018. These 10,000 UNI's will have its correspondent balance in an EUR account (probably offered by Saxo Bank) which is publicly readable and only fully manipulable by the Smart Contract. The comissions for either sell and buy UNI's make the total amount of UNI's grow. We will eventually add more funds to emit more UNI's but there will never be in our bank account more or less Euro than the total amount of UNIE created. This bank account balance will be audited and made publicly visible.

## Sending UNI's

Ethereum Smart Contracts based Blockchain has proved to be a really "safe" system to record Cryptocurrency transactions. We're auditing our Smart Contracts with external companies whose name will be disclosed along with the publication of the audits. We're though, working to transfer all the process to be handled by IOTA because:

Blockchain is slow

Blockchain is expensive

Ethereum has some flaws

Why aren't we going straigth for IOTA then? Because we want to enter into the market fast and IOTA doesn't have yet Smart Contracts [(Oracles)](https://blog.iota.org/iota-development-roadmap-74741f37ed01).

## Wallet

We're using the Ethereum Wallet https://www.ethereum.org/ for back and forth contracts of UNI. Feel free, though, to build your own Wallet.

## Why did we create UNI?

Because we like Bitcoin, but we see a real lack of crypto to fiat liquidity. We've been in the ecommerce world with [Shopify](https://shopify.com) and [Shopify Payments](https://monei.net) for more than 10 years already and we believe there should be alternatives to Bitcoin which really make the difference for Blockchain - IOTA powered financial transactions.

## Are you planning to do an ICO?

Not really, not now at least. Too much hype, too much marketing, too much smoke. We focus on our service and on building something which solves real problems rather than sending email marketing campaigns and doing banners in CoinMarketCap cheating people promising unreal future gains.
