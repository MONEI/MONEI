UNI
=====================================

An experimental Cryptocurrency based on a swing between: EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, AUD

## Value
The formula to get the real time value of 1 UNI is as follows:

| EUR        | VALUE           | CURRENCY  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1      | 1,08485 | USD |
| 1  | 0,860679346      |   GBP |
| 1 | 115,80442     |    JPY |
| 1 | 1,43946813     |    AUD |
| **SUM**        | **119,1894175**           |   |

TOTAL SUM divided by 4 = **29,79735437**

| UNI        | VALUE           | CURRENCY  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1      | 27,46679667 | USD |
| 1  | 34,62073827      |   GBP |
| 1 | 0,257307574     |    JPY |
| 1 | 20,70025293     |    AUD |
| 1 | 29,79735437     |    EUR |
 
This is one of the best ways to have a highly stable currency. More currencies are likely to be added to strengthen the  stability.

*We recommend values to be taken by Currency exchange data providers with no delays*

It's highly posible that people interested in buying your UNIs are willing to close the deal at a higher or lower rate than the reference currency.

## Quantities to be issued

Even it hasn't been fully decided yet, we're emiting 50.000.000 units of UNI as of 1stQ 2017. We're looking to find a way where milions of people can be UNI holders with the same well known distributed minning concept **BUT**: without the need of having a computer or technical skills. Limiting the quantity to avoid inflation is key but producing the sufficient amount to help the currency spread fast enough is key too, so a balance is sought between four factors:

**distributed - democratic creation:** no individual should have a better position over another one to have more UNI newborns.

**limited creation:** real value is key so limiting the creation has a direct impact in the present and future value.

**enough creation:** means enough opportunities for innovation and making this a better balanced society.

**limited ownership:** as in real life no one would or should own 90% of all USD issued for the currency sake. No single wallet can have more than 1% of total UNI's issued. This forces de democratization and stability and prevents mass attacks to web based UNI's depots.


## Sending UNI's

Blockchain has proved to be a really safe "system" to record Cryptocurrency transactions.

## Wallet

We're using the Ethereum Wallet https://www.ethereum.org/ for back and forth contracts of UNI. Feel free, though, to build your own Wallet.

## Why did we create UNI?
Because we like Bitcoin, in fact we own some thousands of them, but have seen some concepts not to be totally democratic or safe for the pure health of the currency. We want a currency which stands for:

a.- limited ownership, for value stability and security
b.- open ownership, not to purely rely on minning
c.- open decisions, based on what the community decides not a central bank
