## Value
The formula to get the real time value of 1 UNI is as follows:

| EUR        | VALUE           | CURRENCY  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1      | 1,08485 | USD |
| 1  | 0,860679346      |   GBP |
| 1 | 115,80442     |    JPY |
| 1 | 1,43946813     |    AUD |
| **SUM**        | **119,1894175**           | **EUR**  |

TOTAL SUM divided by 4 = **29,79735437**

| UNI        | VALUE           | CURRENCY  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1      | 27,46679667 | USD |
| 1  | 34,62073827      |   GBP |
| 1 | 0,257307574     |    JPY |
| 1 | 20,70025293     |    AUD |
| 1 | 29,79735437     |    EUR |
 
This is one of the best ways to have a highly stable currency. More currencies are likely to be added to strengthen the  stability.

*Values should be taken by Currency exchange data providers with no delays like Bloomberg or Reuters.*

It's highly posible that people interested in buying your UNIs are willing to close the deal at a higher or lower rate than the reference currency.

## Quantities to be issued

Even it hasn't been fully decided yet, we're emiting 50.000.000 units of UNI as of 1st Q4 2017. We're looking to find a way where milions of people can be UNI holders with the same distributed minning concept **BUT**: without the need of having a computer or technical skills. Limiting the quantity to avoid inflation is key but producing the sufficient amount to help the currency spread fast enough is key too, so a balance is sought between three factors:

**distributed - democratic creation:** no individual should have a better position over another one to have more UNI newborns.

**limited creation:** real value is key so limiting the creation has a direct impact in the present and future value.

**enough creation:** means enough opportunities for innovation and making this a better balanced society.
