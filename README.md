UNI
=====================================

MONEI's Cryptocurrency with fiat parity, Ethereum powered initially.

## Value
We're working with UNIE as UNI (you and me) and E (Euro). We will add new parity coins like UNIU (Usd) or UNIG (Gbp) in the future.

| EUR        | VALUE           | CURRENCY TICKER |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 1      | 1 | UNIE |


It's possible that people interested in buying your UNIs are willing to close the deal at a higher or lower rate than the reference currency, as the quantity issued is limited.

## Quantities to be issued

Even it hasn't been fully decided yet, we're emiting 10.000 units of UNIE as of 1stQ 2018. The comissions for either sell and buy UNI's will make the total amount of UNIS grow. We will eventually add more funds to emit more UNIS but there will never be in our bank account more or less Euro than the total amount of UNIE created. This bank account balance will be audited and made publicly visible.

## Sending UNI's

Ethereum Smart Contracts based Blockchain has proved to be a really "safe" system to record Cryptocurrency transactions. We're auditing our Smart Contracts with external companies, and all of them will be made public. We're though, working to transfer all the process to be handled by IOTA because:

Blockchain is slow

Blockchain is expensive

Ethereum has some flaws

Why aren't we going straigth for IOTA then? Because we want to enter into the market fast and IOTA doesn't have yet Smart Contracts [(Oracles)](https://blog.iota.org/iota-development-roadmap-74741f37ed01).

## Wallet

We're using the Ethereum Wallet https://www.ethereum.org/ for back and forth contracts of UNI. Feel free, though, to build your own Wallet.

## Why did we create UNI?
Because we like Bitcoin, but we see a real lack of crypto to fiat liquidity. We've been in the ecommerce world with Shopify for more than 10 years already and we believe there should be alternatives to Bitcoin which really make the difference for Blockchain - IOTA powered financial transactions.
