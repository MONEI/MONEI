MONEI token
=====================================

MONEI's Cryptocurrency with fiat parity, Ethereum powered.

## Value

| EUR        | VALUE           | CURRENCY TICKER | DECIMALS |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| 1      | 1 | EURⓂ | 8
| 1      | 1 | USDⓂ | 8
| 1      | 1 | GBPⓂ | 8


## Real use cases not supported by banks

Send micropayments

Create recurring transactions (send MONEI's) every second or pre-defined time frames

Create transactions (send MONEI's) based on events (fully flexible API to process payments)

Send MONEI's to shared wallets

Send MONEI's to email addresses, mobile phones or any device

Create more MONEI's based on the interest of users of converting their fiat into MONEI's

Share part of the comissions (buy and sell MONEI's) with the community by giving interest to the users holding the MONEI's in the Smart Contract

## Quantities to be issued

We're emiting 10,000 units of EURⓂ as of 1stQ 2018. These 10,000 EURⓂ have its correspondent balance in our EUR account which is publicly readable, audited and only fully manipulable by the Smart Contract.

## Sending MONEI's

Ethereum Smart Contracts based Blockchain has proved to be a really "safe" system to record Cryptocurrency transactions. We're auditing our Smart Contracts with external companies whose name will be disclosed along with the publication of the audits. We're though, working to transfer all the process to be handled by IOTA because:

Blockchain is slow

Blockchain is expensive

Ethereum has some flaws

Why aren't we going straigth for IOTA then? Because we want to enter into the market fast and IOTA doesn't have yet Smart Contracts [(Oracles)](https://blog.iota.org/iota-development-roadmap-74741f37ed01).

## Wallet

We're using the Ethereum Wallet https://www.ethereum.org/ for back and forth contracts of MONEI. Feel free, though, to build your own Wallet.

## Why did we create the MONEI token?

Because we like Bitcoin, but we see a real lack of crypto to fiat liquidity. We've been in the ecommerce world with [Shopify](https://shopify.com) and [Shopify Payments](https://monei.net) for more than 10 years already and we believe there should be alternatives to Bitcoin which really make the difference for Blockchain - IOTA powered financial transactions.

## Are you planning to do an ICO?

Not really, not now at least. We focus on our service and on building something which solves real problems rather than sending email marketing campaigns and doing banners in CoinMarketCap cheating people promising unreal future gains.
